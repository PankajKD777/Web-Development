                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>              <b> Narendra Damodardas Modi </b> was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his
                    secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has discussed having to
                    work as a child in his father's tea stall in the Vadnagar railway station, which has not been
                    reliably corroborated. At age 18, Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he
                    abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades
                    later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has
                    asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting
                    a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to
                    Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency was
                    declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him
                    to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to
                    the rank of general secretary.</p>
